We worked with them to re-imagine their print identity for digital use. They wanted the identity to better reflect their music. It needed to be more fluid and engaging. During the process, we recognized 3 NYO mission principles:

- To inspire youth
- To be open to the nation
- To create incredible orchestral performances

These guided us in our response. We developed several concept routes, ultimately producing 1 animated identity which is displayed before NYO video content.
