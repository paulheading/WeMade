**The Client:** PLAY!

**The Project:** Charles Hazlewood (with Army of Generals and the British Paraorchestra) performed the music of classic video games live at the Barbican. We drew and animated the Barbican estate as an 8-bit arcade game, before the event travelled to Leeds. Leeds Council were keen to retain this identity, so asked us to create the same experience with Leeds Town Hall.

**The Result:** Concept work, animations
