There are 4 people in the Barbican in-house design team. We produce the majority of marketing collateral associated with events at the Barbican.

Our previous guidelines were created by North in 2012 and lived inside a beautiful, printed book. Weâ€™re very proud of this book, but it could not adapt and evolve with the brand during the following 6 years.

We needed a new solution.

We decided that we needed a single, shareable, publicly accessible set of guidelines. This should be a living set of guidelines that responds quickly and easily to change.

This is why we created the [Barbican Guidelines](https://guidelines.barbican.org.uk).
